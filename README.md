# Banking Management System

This **Banking Management System (BMS)** is a simple, console-based application built in **C++**. It helps manage customer accounts, transactions, deposits, withdrawals, and donations. Account information and transaction records are stored in text files for persistence, ensuring no data loss between program executions.

## Features

- **Create New Account**  
  Register a new customer account with the following details:
  - Account number
  - Account balance
  - Password
  - First name
  - Last name  
  Data is stored in a persistent file for future access.

- **View Account Details**  
  View the balance and details of an existing account by verifying the correct PIN.

- **Deposit Funds**  
  Deposit money into an account.

- **Withdraw Funds**  
  Withdraw money from an account, ensuring the user has sufficient balance.

- **Donate Funds**  
  Transfer funds to a donation account for charitable purposes.

- **Transactions**  
  Transfer money from one account to another.

- **PIN Verification**  
  For security, users must enter a correct PIN to view their account details or perform any transaction. Users have three attempts to enter the correct PIN.

All account details and transaction records are stored in files (`account.txt`, `deposit.txt`, `donation.txt`, and `withdrawal.txt`) to ensure data persistence between program executions.
