# Banking Management System

This **Banking Management System (BMS)** is a simple, console-based application built in **C++**. It helps manage customer accounts, transactions, withdrawals, and displays account details. Account information is stored in text files for persistence, ensuring no loss of data between program executions.

---

## Features

- **Create New Account**  
  Register a new customer account with the following details:
  - Account number
  - Account balance
  - Password
  - First name
  - Last name  
  Data is stored in a persistent file for future access.

- **View Account Details**  
  View the balance and details of an existing account by verifying the correct PIN.

- **Transactions**  
  Transfer money from one account to another.

- **Withdraw Funds**  
  Withdraw funds from an account after PIN verification.

- **PIN Verification**  
  For security, users must enter a correct PIN to view their account details or perform any transaction. Users have three attempts to enter the correct PIN.

All account details and transaction records are stored in files (`accountdetails.txt` and `transactiondetails.txt`) to ensure data persistence between program executions.

## File Structure

- **Files:**
  - `accountdetails.txt`: Stores account details for each user (account number, balance, password, first name, last name).
  - `transactiondetails.txt`: Stores transaction details (from account, to account, amount transferred).

- **Code File:**
  - `main.cpp`: Contains the full implementation of the Banking Management System, including functions for creating accounts, displaying account details, handling transactions, and withdrawals.

   - **Option 3**: Exit the program.

2. **Creating an Account**:
   - Enter your account number, initial balance, and set a password for your account.
   - The account will be stored in `accountdetails.txt`.

3. **Account Verification**:
   - To access account details or perform transactions, enter your account number and PIN.
   - If the PIN is correct, you will be allowed to view your balance or perform the selected operation.

4. **Transactions**:
   - To transfer money, enter the sending account number, the receiving account number, and the amount to transfer.
   - A successful transfer will update the account balances and store the transaction in `transactiondetails.txt`.

5. **Withdrawals**:
   - Enter the account number and the amount to withdraw.
   - Withdrawals are allowed only if sufficient funds are available in the account.
